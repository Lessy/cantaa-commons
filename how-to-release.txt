## Prepare software
- Pull the branch you want to release
- Set the version in the POM's
- Deploy with profiles gpg-release and sonytype-oss-release
  mvn clean deploy -P ...

## Release Software to Central
- Browse to https://oss.sonatype.org and login
- under Build Promotion, goto Staging Repositories
- Sort the list by Updated and search for comcantaa
- Close the Repo
- Wait until ready (do a refresh). Takes about 2 Minutes.
- If all is okay (see under tab "activity"): release the Repo
  If not okay: check the reason and drop the Repo, start over with corrections
- Wait until release is published on central (24 hours)

## Signing artifacts
- The artifacts are signed with a specific public key. The name of the key is stored in the parent pom. Eventually
  change that to another public key
- To create a new key-pair: gpg --gen-key
- Upload the public key to a trusted key-server
